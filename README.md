# What is it
This project develops an educational tool that helps people understand climate change through
an interactive 3D globe visualization. Using five years of data from NASA's Orbiting Carbon
Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite, we performed comprehensive data analysis to understand
carbon emission patterns across different countries. The analysis involved preprocessing
satellite data, calculating country-specific emission averages, and identifying major emission
sources. We strategically selected countries across various development stages and continents
to provide a balanced global perspective on emission patterns.
Additionally, we incorporated sea level data from NASA's monitoring systems to present multiple
aspects of climate change. The project transforms this complex climate data into an engaging
educational experience by combining visual elements with audio narration generated through
text-to-speech models. Users can explore different locations on the interactive globe while
listening to data-driven stories about each region's climate impact and challenges.
The resulting tool makes climate science more accessible and engaging for the general public,
helping bridge the gap between complex scientific data and public understanding of climate
change.
