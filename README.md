# What is it
This project develops an educational tool that helps people understand climate change through an interactive 3D globe visualization. Using five years of data from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite, we performed comprehensive data analysis to uncover carbon emission patterns across different countries. The analysis involved preprocessing satellite data, calculating country-specific emission averages, and identifying major emission sources. To provide a balanced global perspective, we strategically selected countries across various development stages and continents.

Additionally, we incorporated sea-level data from NASA's monitoring systems to present multiple aspects of climate change. The project transforms this complex climate data into an engaging educational experience by combining visual elements with audio narration generated through text-to-speech models. Users can explore different locations on the interactive globe while listening to data-driven stories about each region's climate impact and challenges.

To design and develop the interactive 3D globe visualization, we utilized **Articulate 360**, a robust tool known for creating dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly learning experiences. Articulate 360 allowed us to seamlessly integrate 3D elements with educational content, ensuring an intuitive and engaging user interface.

The resulting tool makes climate science more accessible and engaging for the general public, helping bridge the gap between complex scientific data and public understanding of climate change. By leveraging Articulate 360â€™s capabilities, we created a platform that delivers a multi-sensory experience, empowering users to explore climate challenges interactively, fostering awareness, and inspiring action.
